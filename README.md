### 🧠 Why Design Properties Matter

Understanding and identifying **design properties** (like colors, fonts, and sizes) in a mockup is essential because:

- 🎯 They maintain **visual consistency** across all pages and components  
- 🎨 They help ensure **brand identity and professional aesthetics**  
- 📱 They allow developers to **accurately translate designs into code**  
- ⚙️ They improve **efficiency** in collaborative team environments (especially with designers and developers)
- ✅ They ensure the final product aligns with **user expectations and accessibility standards**

By aligning development with Figma's defined styles, we create a polished, user-friendly interface that feels intuitive and cohesive across devices.
